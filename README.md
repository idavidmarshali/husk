# husk discord Bot - Master Branch V2.0

__**Updates**__:
1. Change in the maincommand `error_handler` (More efficient and it looks better)
2. Few commands are removed including: `MoveRage` - `Logger`..
3. The old helpcommand has been replaced by a  `dynamic Menu based Help command` to automate command adding.
4. The bot has become more object oriented (if we ignore d.py), you can see all new objects in `sdk/husk_sdk.py`
5. Changed the old Hex command with a new menu based one.
6. The clear command can now take an optional member arg for check and its now menu based with confirmation.
7. The problem with the cuddle command has been fixed.
8. Husk now answers to users questions thanks to `celverbot api`
9. Move all command has become better in terms of error raising and member fetching.
10. added an SDK file for easier usage.

# Notes:
`bot is not using the stable version of d.py 1.6.0! its using a unstable clone from the master branch, its not recommended to use the master branch.`



# WillDo:
some of the things that are going to be added up to the version 3.0
1. guild based `Logger` for the bot with advanced logging dynamics
2. Full menu based bot configuration using the early version of `discord.Buttons`
3. refactoring the helpcommand to be more `Cat` based.
4. adding an `RolePlay` type game like `Mafia`.
5. [This is ridiculous] but using `discord.Buttons` to control an `gameboy emulator` via twitch
and many more..
so stay tuned :)
